# 4) The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:
#
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#
# What would the following return?
#
# numbers.delete_at(1) removes number 2 from the array
# numbers.delete(1) removes number 1 from the array

#5)
10..100.covers?(42)

#6)
famous_words = "Four score at" + famous_words
famous words = "Four score at" << famous_words


#7) 42

flintstones = flintstones.flatten

#9)
flintstones.select(|k,v|, k == "Barney")

#10)
flinstones.each_with_index do |value, index|
     my_hash[value] = index
end
